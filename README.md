My AutoHotkey Scripts

* Terminal launch launches with the shortcut Win+Enter, I wanted to make Windows feel as close to a linux distros with a tiling window manager as posible.
* AutoOnTop makes the focused windows to always stay on top with the shortcut Ctrl+Space
* HideTaskBar auto show/hide the taskbar wit shortcut Win+T

  *  You might want to enable automatically hide the taskbar in desktop mode (and) tablet mode so that the programs can use the space left when you hide the Taskbar
